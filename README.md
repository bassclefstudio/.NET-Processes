# .NET-Processes
Provides additional classes for dealing with common scenarios involving the Process class. Built on .NET Standard 2.0, and is (potentially) compatible with all supported operating systems and project types under the .NET Standard umbrella (although certain projects such as UWP and Xamarin apps may have restrictions on the `System.Diagnostics.Process` class).
